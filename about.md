<p>Hi! This is my Maps Blog. I'm learning about all kinds of maps online, such as <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>, among others.</p>

<p>I thought it would be fun to document a bit of my journey in learning about maps and their features/details.</p>

<p>This journey started by accident when I had a project that involved documenting properties for a department in a non-profit. I became interested in bits and pieces of the world of online mapping.</p>

<p>This is also my first time using Jekyll. I probably will document a bit of that as well. It would be interesting to compare it with other static content generators as well!</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed reading some of the posts and please do feel free to leave a comment on whatever caught your attention.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
